        <div class="one">Hi! I'm Arjay B. Mercado currently 19 years old and a freshman student at Pangasinan State University (PSU) Asingan Campus with a course of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. 

            The thing I do love about myself is having a somewhat passion that makes me wonder the beauty of existence - I do play instruments, write songs about something that bothers me, I also do some poetries, and last things I do love is staying up late night because at this hour the environment was very silent and peaceful. These passion made me expressed what I've feel in past and my current situation, those things inside of my head that I can't let go, and these passion keeps me alive at this time.
            
            I can't wait to say to myself "we made it", that all these things we've done actually made a sense and will bring me on what status I must be in.</div>
