        <div class="one">Hello, I'm Francis Nathalie F. De Leon, a first-year student at PSU Asingan Campus, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a deep passion for the arts and crafts. Singing and dancing are not just hobbies for me; they're my escape and a way to express myself. I also find joy in the intricate art of crocheting, where I create beautiful and functional pieces. Music is a constant companion in my life, and I love exploring various genres. Whether I'm belting out tunes, perfecting dance moves, creating cozy crochet items, or immersed in the world of melodies, I find balance in these diverse hobbies that enrich my college experience.</div>
