        <div class="one">Hello, I'm Epifanio A. Mendoza III, a first-year student at PSU Asingan Campus, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). My academic journey is marked by a commitment to excellence and a passion for exploring the dynamic field of IT. Beyond the confines of my coursework, I find solace and inspiration in my hobbies, namely photography, where I capture the world through a lens, distilling moments into visual stories. Nature tripping is another cherished pastime, allowing me to disconnect from the digital realm and immerse myself in the beauty of the natural world. Also, I am an avid music enthusiast, finding joy and relaxation in the diverse melodies that resonate with different facets of life. These hobbies not only provide a welcome escape but also contribute to my holistic development by fostering creativity, mindfulness, and a balanced perspective. As I navigate the complexities of academia, I am excited to merge my technical expertise with the creative insights gained from my hobbies, creating a well-rounded approach to both my studies and personal interests.</div>
