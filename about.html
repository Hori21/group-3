        <div class="one">Hi, I'm John Paul Ramirez, a freshman at Pangasinan State University Asingan Campus, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). I'm a nice, fun, and friendly person who works well in a team but also independently. I set ambitious goals for myself, possessing good listening and communication skills. Eager to learn and always up for new challenges, I am well-organized and plan ahead to manage my time effectively. Beyond my studies, I thrive in the lively campus environment, connecting with peers and actively participating in extracurricular pursuits. This blend of academic and social engagements contributes to my overall personal development. In terms of hobbies, I love binge-watching movies, series, and documentaries, with a preference for compelling storylines. This concludes a comprehensive overview of myself."</div>
